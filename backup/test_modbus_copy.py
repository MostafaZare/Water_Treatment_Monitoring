"""
In this advanced test script, I've included:

Structured logging using the logging module.
A test_sensor_readings function that attempts to read from each sensor and logs the results.
Try-except blocks for handling potential errors during sensor communication.
Please note that I've assumed the existence of RadarSensor, TrubSensor, and PHSensor classes which handle the specifics of interacting with those devices via Modbus.
These classes should provide a read_data method that encapsulates the Modbus read logic. 
The script is designed to be a starting point for building out your testing procedures.

For the projct, you would need to adjust the register addresses and the instantiation of the sensor objects to match the actual devices you are working with. 
Additionally, you might include more comprehensive tests, assertions, and perhaps integration with a testing framework like unittest or pytest."""
