It creates an instance of the GPIOControl class.
Depending on the action specified, it sets the pin high, sets the pin low, or reads the value of the pin.
It includes error handling to catch any exceptions that might occur during GPIO operations.
It ensures that the GPIO pin is cleaned up at the end of the operations, even if an error occurs.

python GPIOExample.py 4 high
#This would set GPIO pin 4 to high. Similarly, you can set it to low or read its value.
